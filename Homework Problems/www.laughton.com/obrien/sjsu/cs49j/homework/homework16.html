<p><span class="attention">Remember not to create packages. Use the default package</span></p>
<p style="background-color: #ccffff">16A </p>
<p>Write a class, <code>TextCondensor</code>, whose constructor takes an<code> ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code> as a parameter. Save the ArrayList as the only instance variable.</p>
<p>Provide methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>public Set&lt;String&gt; condenseText</code>() which removes  any duplicates and returns an Set&lt;String&gt; containing words without duplicates and in alphabetical order. Think Set</li>
  <li><code>public int condensedSize()</code> which gets the number of unique elements in the text. Do this efficiently without duplicating code already written. Do not use an unnecessary instance variable.</li>
  <li><code>public void setList(ArrayList&lt;String&gt; newText) </code>which sets a new list of text</li>
  <li><code>public double relativeSize() </code>gets the percent the condensed text is of the original ( condensed size / original size) * 100</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the files you will need:</p>
<pre class="example">humpty.txt:

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put Humpty together again.

mary.txt:

Mary had a little lamb, little lamb,
little lamb, Mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went, everywhere
that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go.

He followed her to school one day,
school one day, school one day,
He followed her to school one day,
Which was against the rules,
It made the children laugh and play,
laugh and play, laugh and play,
It made the children laugh and play,
To see a lamb at school.

And so the teacher turned it out,
turned it out, turned it out,
And so the teacher turned it out,
But still it lingered near,
He waited patiently about,
ly about, ly about,
He waited patiently about,
Till Mary did appear.

"Why does the lamb love Mary so?"
love Mary so?" love Mary so?"
"Why does the lamb love Mary so?"
The eager children cried.
"Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know,"
lamb, you know," lamb, you know,"
"Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know,"
The teacher did reply

<p>The sieve of Earthosthenes is an algorithm for finding all the prime numbers less that or equal to a given integer. With a piece of paper the process would be:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Write down all the numbers less than or equal to n. Cross out all the multiples of 2 (except 2) Cross out all the multiples of 3 ... up to the square root of n. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Be sure  to  use a <strong>set</strong> in your implementation. You can simulate crossing out the multiples by removing the element. Do not use arrays.</p>
<p>You are to write a class <code>Sieve</code>. </p>
<p>It has a constructor that takes as a parameter the upper limit for the primes</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>public Sieve(int upperLimit)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It has methods</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>public Set&lt;Integer&gt; getPrimes()</code> which returns a set containing all the primes less than or equal to the upper limit. The numbers should be in increasing order. Implement the algorithm using a set.</li>
  <li><code>public void setUpperLimit(int newLimit)</code> which sets a new upper limit for this sieve</li>
  <li><code>public int primeCount()</code> which returns the number of primes that are less than the upper limit. Do this efficiently without duplicating code already written. (That is, this method should call the <code>getPrimes</code> method rather than finding the primes itself)</li>
</ul>
